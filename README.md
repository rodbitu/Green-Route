## 💻 Project
Green Route is an innovative solution for optimizing urban waste collection, using IoT sensors and data analysis to make the process more efficient and sustainable.

## 🚀 Solution

### 📡 Deployment of IoT sensors in waste bins
- Sensors monitor the fill level of waste bins.
- Real-time communication with the central system.

### 📊 Data analysis for optimizing collection routes
- Optimization algorithms are used to plan efficient routes.
- Reduction of operational costs and CO2 emissions.

## 🔥 Addressed Problems

### ❌ Inefficiencies in urban waste management
- Irregular and non-optimized collection.
- Excess of full and underutilized waste bins.

### 🌍 Environmental impact of collection and disposal
- Increase in CO2 emissions due to inefficient routes.
- Soil and water contamination from improper waste disposal.

### ♻️ Insufficient selective collection
- Low recycling rate.
- Waste of recyclable materials.

### 💰 Lack of development in the recyclable materials market
- Low appreciation of recyclable materials.
- Low adoption of new technologies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### 🔧 Hardware
- ESP32
- Load cell

### 💻 Software
- React (Web Frontend)
- Mapbox (Map display and route calculation)
